How to use the Makefile in this directory
-----------------------------------------

You should be inside this directory in order to use the Makefile.

make:
	Updates the POT file (alexandria.pot).

make xx.po:
	(Where xx is a language code.)

	Merge a single PO file with the template. The template is updated if
	necessary.

make po:
	Merges all of the PO files with the template. The template is updated
	if necessary. This command is suitable for generating the PO files to
	send to translators prior to a release.

make check:
	Prints the status of all of the PO files, i.e. how complete each
	translation is. Any problems with the PO files will also be reported.
