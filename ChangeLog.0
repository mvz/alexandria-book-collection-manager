	* added new Z39.50 provider "Servizio Bibliotecario Nazionale (Italy)"
	* added the FAQ
	* added hotkey "<control>O" for preferences
	* allowed manual entry of books without author (for instance
	  9788841574195 has no author)
	* in the "Book Properties Dialog", added "cancel" button, and
	  renamed "close" button to "save"
	* improved error messages
	* ignored empty lines when importing a list of ISBNs
	* added info in case that Alexandria can't load optional libraries
	* book_providers.rb: added debug message in case that a book is
	  not found
	* book_properties_dialog.rb: keeps ISBN-13 instead to convert to ISBN
	* publishing_year is converted to integer when quitting,
	  importing a Tellico library, or with some providers
	* clean.css: added foreground color, see
	  http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/color for the reason
	* import_library.rb smart_library.rb main_app.rb: changed
	  variable name from MAX_STARS to MAX_RATING_STARS, and replaced
	  some occurrences of '5' with MAX_RATING_STARS
	* library.rb: canonicalise_ean now removes dashes and spaces
	* added debug info about which provider the book has been found at
	* export_library.rb:
	- export_library.rb: changed from "Generated" to "Generated on
	  #{Date.today()}", when exporting to BibTex or HTML web page
	- Added optional requirement "image_size", in order to provide
	  data for the images like
	  height='143' width='95'
	  when exporting to HTML web page or to Tellico
	** HTML export:
	- Changed type from Transitional to Strict when exporting to
	  HTML web page
	- used CGI.escapeHTML when exporting HTML web page (for the
	  moment, CGI.escapeHTML is not used for title and authors,
	  because they may contain HTML entities (bug to be fixed on the
	  providers site))
	**  ONIX export:
	- exported publishing_year, and modified PublisherName to fit
	  more strict requirements
	- reordered elements, in order to make it valid XML
	- Added element Publisher/PublishingRole = '01' when exporting to ONIX
	- fixed "ProductWebSite" -> "ProductWebsite" when exporting ONIX
	** Tellico export:
	- removed description of the field "rating", which is already
	  present in recent Tellico versions
	- renamed things from "bookcase" to "tellico"
	- changed doctype and syntaxVersion to version 7 (the earliest
	  version for which there is still a DTD) in order to allow the
	  library to be imported also by older versions of Tellico.
	- added attribute "id", required by tellico.dtd
	- added export of publishing_year

	* import_library.rb:
	- now some messages are displayed only if $DEBUG
	** Tellico import
	- added rating
	- checked that "rating" is in [1,2,3,4,5]. If not, "rating" is ignored.
	- canonicalise_ean is used (because Tellico returns EAN with dashes)
	- fixed import, even if "authors" is empty

	* test_providers.rb
	- improved test of thalia.rb: added foreign book, DVD, CD
	- added test for provider LOC and a book with non-ASCII letters
	- test of provider MCU: added test that bugs [#2533] and [#2518]
	  are fixed
	- added test of SBN, LOC and BL, and grouped together tests of
          providers depending on optional libraries

	* z3950.rb:
	- refactored
	- the user must specify charset, when adding new providers. default
	  charset is ISO-8859-1
	- now, when searching by ISBN, the ISBN of the returned book is
	  the ISBN used in the search. This because ruby/zoom has a bug,
	  and may return a cutted ISBN, or because the z39.50 server may
	  return more than one ISBN.
	- when searching by ISBN, only one record is asked from the provider
	- added element_set_name = 'F', in order to return the 'full'
	  set of data (SBN default is 'brief')
	- added support for books without ISBN
	- fixed bug, publish_year can be unbound
	- added function url(book) for LOC and BL
	- added info about Copac
	- returns output even if author is empty
	- uses Library.canonicalise_isbn on input and
	  Library.canonicalise_ean on output
	- fixed bug about publish_year for BL
	- publisher and edition are nil instead of ""
	- now returns [Book.new(...)] instead of [Book.new(...), nil]
	  (where nil is the image). This is required to pass the test.
	- other minor changes

	* various fixes and updates for the providers:
	- adlibris.rb bn.rb bol_it.rb dea_store_it.rb ibs_it.rb ls.rb
	  renaud.rb thalia.rb webster_it.rb worldcat.rb :
	  added to the function to_book of each provider code like
	  raise NoResultsError if /not found/.match(data) != nil
	- worldcat.rb improved
	- worldcat.rb: allowed to return nul as ISBN (this provider
	  lists also old books without ISBN)

	  chars with dots
	- webster_it.rb: updated, site now supports ISBN-13
	- webster_it.rb improved for handling books like 9788830417588
	  with wrong image
	- adlibris.rb: fixed authors and publish_year
	- proxis.rb:
	-- now returns the ISBN-13
	-- fixed 'url',which requires ISBN-10
	-- in the user preferences, changed "Locale" to "Language",
	  which is more meaningful, corresponds closer to the code, and
	  is for a different topic of "Locale" used by Amazon
	- ibs_it.rb: partially updated, to make it work again. It is
	  still necessary to fix authors, edition, publish_year
	- BL fixed "authors"
	- thalia.rb: updated
	- dea_store_it.rb:
	-- minor improvements
	-- updated (the site has switched to ISBN-13)

	  not by hpricot (used by mechanize), and may be installed or not)
	-- modified to return "Surname, Name"
	- renaud.rb: now supports also books in the section for youngs
